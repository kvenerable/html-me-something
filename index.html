                <h2>BooHoo</h2>

They too offer Clothing, Shoes, and Accessories. The great thing about BooHoo is that they always have a sale every single day which is usually a percentage off with free shipping. They offer sizes 1X - 3X and 16- 22 in all clothing options. They even took it to another level to provide plus size accessories. Boohoo is only avaiable online while they are only located in the UK.

        Last but not least is <a href ="https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwicurXCgMHdAhXQuMAKHXWkDv4YABABGgJpbQ&sig=AOD64_0Zt8_p-y1ecHEGFWD3MsWVWAZwbw&adurl=&q=&ved=2ahUKEwissa7CgMHdAhUQRKwKHcvWAboQqyQoAHoECAIQDA">Charolette Russe</a>. Just like the above mentioned stores Charolette Russe is also your one stop shop for Clothing, Shoes, Accessories. Their sizes run from a 1X -4X and 10- 22. This store by far has the best shoe sales of all time. Shoes are typically BOGO or a percentage off is usually rendered. They also offer a pretty impressive clearance sale. You can find fabulous items as low as $4.99 but no higher than $14.99. If you're lucky, you may also be able to stack this with a coupon code that can be found at <a href= "https://www.retailmenot.com/view/charlotterusse.com">Retail Me Not</a>.
